  My name is Sijie Ma（马思捷）. I am now pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in CS at SCUT.
</p>

<p style="font-family: Roboto, 宋体; font-size: 12.0pt; vertical-align: baseline;">
  I am interested in machine learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, computational intelligence, and black-box optimization. I am now working on how to solve black-box optimization problems with better algorithms :smile:
